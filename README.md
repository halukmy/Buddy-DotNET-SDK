# Buddy .NET SDK

These release notes are for the Buddy Platform .NET SDK.

Please refer to [dev.buddyplatform.com/docs](http://dev.buddyplatform.com/docs) for more details on the .NET SDK.

## Introduction

Buddy enables developers to build engaging, cloud-connected apps without having to write, test, manage or scale server-side code or infrastructure. We noticed that most mobile app developers end up writing the same code over and over again: user management, photo management, geolocation checkins, metadata, and more.  

Buddy's easy-to-use, scenario-focused APIs let you spend more time building your app, and less time worrying about backend infrastructure.  

Let us handle that stuff for you!

## Features

For developers the Buddy Platform offers turnkey support for features like the following:

* *User Accounts* - create, delete, authenticate users.
* *Photos* - add photos, search photos, share photos with other users.
* *Geolocation* - check in, search for places, list past checkins.
* *Push Notifications* - easily send push notifications to iOS, Android, or Microsoft devices.
* *Messaging* - send messages to other users, create message groups.
* *User Lists* - set up relationships between users.
* *Game Scores, Metadata, and Boards* - keep track of game scores and states for individual users as well as across users.
* *And more* - check out the rest of the offering at [buddy.com](http://buddy.com)
